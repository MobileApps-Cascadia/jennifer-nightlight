Nightlight
==========

Purpose and users

This is a soothing, personalized, animated nightlight.  This would be for parents that want a mildly entertaining means of getting children into bed, or they want something different from the standard, stationary nightlight, or possibly for people that just want to look at something soothing and mind-numbing.

At the home screen there are three options - "play," "nightlight," and "settings" (possibly future edition will have "personalize").  In the play mode, touching the screen creates shapes (starting with stars) that continue to emanate from where the screen is touched, they bounce around while creating some sound (tinkling for stars) and then slowly disappear.  As you lift your finger and touch the screen a different shape then emanates with different sounds.  In the nightlight version the shapes do not vanish off screen and the app doesn't go to sleep from lack of interaction.  Children could determine the number of a particular shape (by holding down their finger) or get a nice variety (by repeatedly lifting and touching) for their nightlight.  Possibly "personalize" function will add pictures in bubble shapes to make it even more personalized so that people could have pictures of their family/friends bouncing around their nightlight.  Also, the colors of the background and shapes themselves will be smoothly changing.  The shapes will be mathematically programmed to be in coordinating colors to the background.  When different shapes are on the screen at the same time (from lifting and touching the screen multiple times) the coordinating colors of different shapes to be different which might mean a different color coordination formula would come into play if different shapes are on the screen at the same time. In the Settings page, sound volume, in-app purchasing, and brightness are customizable options.
